## Birds In Sky: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Birds In Sky app for Android!

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. Some personal data will be gathered and stored on your device and on our cloud storage. the data collected from our side is just used for user information.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Jitusingh Rajpurohit.
